The transformer model is a type of neural network architecture that excels at processing sequential data, most prominently associated with large language models (LLMs). Transformer models have also achieved elite performance in other fields of artificial intelligence (AI), such as computer vision, speech recognition and time series forecasting.

The transformer architecture was first described in the seminal 2017 paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani and others, which is now considered a watershed moment in deep learning.

Originally introduced as an evolution of the recurrent neural network (RNN)-based sequence-to-sequence models used for machine translation, transformer-based models have since attained cutting-edge advancements across nearly every machine learning (ML) discipline.

Despite their versatility, transformer models are still most commonly discussed in the context of natural language processing (NLP) use cases, such as chatbots, text generation, summarization, question answering and sentiment analysis.

The BERT (or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) encoder-decoder model, introduced by Google in 2019, was a major landmark in the establishment of transformers and remains the basis of most modern word embedding applications, from modern vector databases to Google search.

Autoregressive decoder-only LLMs, such as the GPT-3 (short for Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model that powered the launch of OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT, catalyzed the modern era of generative AI (gen AI).

The ability of transformer models to intricately discern how each part of a data sequence influences and correlates with the others also lends them many multimodal uses.

For instance, vision transformers (ViTs) often exceed the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on image segmentation, object detection and related tasks. The transformer architecture also powers many diffusion models used for image generation, multimodal text-to-speech (TTS) and vision language models (VLMs)
